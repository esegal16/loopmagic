# COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE UNDERWRITING ANALYSIS
## The Shenandoah | 2162 SW 14th Ter, Miami, FL

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Shenandoah presents a fully renovated, 24-unit multifamily property in Miami's desirable Shenandoah neighborhood at an asking price of $8.0M ($333,333/unit). While the property benefits from a 2020 gut renovation with $2.4M invested and 100% occupancy, the analysis is severely hampered by the absence of critical financial data including current rents, operating expenses, and NOI. The 1925 vintage building with Class C designation and premium pricing suggests limited upside potential in a market that may be experiencing valuation compression.

## 2. RECOMMENDATION

**PASS** (conditional on receiving financial data)

---

## 3. CONFIDENCE LEVEL

**LOW**

### Contributing Factors:

**Negative Confidence Factors:**
- **No financial data provided** - Absence of rent roll, NOI, cap rate, or operating expenses makes accurate valuation impossible
- **No comparable sales data** - Cannot verify if $333k/unit is market-appropriate for Class C product
- **Age concerns** - 1925 construction (98 years old) likely carries deferred maintenance risks despite 2020 renovation
- **Limited unit mix** - All 24 units are identical 2BR/1BA configuration, reducing tenant diversity and market appeal

**Positive Confidence Factors:**
- Strong location metrics (Walk Score 77, desirable Shenandoah neighborhood)
- Recent major capital investment documented ($2.4M renovation)
- Full occupancy indicates market acceptance
- CBRE representation suggests institutional-quality marketing

## 4. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

### Critical Data Gaps:
⚠️ **MAJOR LIMITATION**: No income, expense, or NOI data provided. Analysis based on market assumptions and reverse engineering.

### Asking Price Assessment:

**Price Per Unit: $333,333**
- **Market Context**: Miami multifamily has seen significant price appreciation, but $333k/unit for Class C product appears aggressive
- **Typical Range**: Class C Miami properties typically trade $150k-$250k/unit depending on submarket
- **Assessment**: **20-40% premium to typical Class C pricing**

**Price Per SF: $416/SF** ($8.0M ÷ 19,235 SF)
- **Market Context**: Miami multifamily PSF ranges $200-$500+ depending on class and location
- **Class C Typical**: $200-$300/SF
- **Class B Typical**: $300-$400/SF
- **Assessment**: **Priced at Class B levels for Class C product**

### Reverse-Engineered Financial Assumptions:

**Estimated Market Rent Analysis:**
- Average unit size: 801 SF (19,235 SF ÷ 24 units)
- Market rent for renovated 2BR/1BA in Shenandoah: **$1,800-$2,200/month**
- Assumed blended rent: **$2,000/month**

**Pro Forma Income (Estimated):**
```
Gross Potential Rent:        $576,000  (24 units × $2,000 × 12)
Vacancy Loss (5%):           ($28,800)
Effective Gross Income:      $547,200
Operating Expenses (45%):    ($246,240)
Net Operating Income:        $300,960
```

**Implied Returns at $8.0M:**
- **Implied Cap Rate: 3.76%** ($300,960 ÷ $8,000,000)
- **Gross Rent Multiplier: 13.9x** ($8,000,000 ÷ $576,000)

### Return Analysis:

**At 75% LTV ($6.0M loan, $2.0M equity):**
- Assumed rate: 7.0%, 30-year amortization
- Annual debt service: $479,112
- Cash flow: **-$178,152** (negative cash flow)
- **Cash-on-Cash Return: -8.9%** ❌

**At 65% LTV ($5.2M loan, $2.8M equity):**
- Annual debt service: $415,564
- Cash flow: **-$114,604** (negative cash flow)
- **Cash-on-Cash Return: -4.1%** ❌

**Break-Even Cap Rate Analysis:**
- To achieve 6% CoC at 70% LTV: Requires ~5.5% cap rate
- **Current implied 3.76% cap rate is 32% below break-even**

### Assessment:
🚨 **SIGNIFICANTLY OVERPRICED** based on estimated financials. Property appears to be priced for appreciation play rather than cash flow, which is extremely risky in rising rate environment.

   - Requires significant equity or seller financing
   - **Risk Level**: CRITICAL

   - Plumbing, electrical, foundation issues common in 1920s construction
   - **Potential exposure**: $500k-$1M in deferred maintenance
   - **Mitigation**: Require comprehensive Property Condition Assessment (
